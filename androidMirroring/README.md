If you want to screen mirror your android, the following file has the easiest connection which worked in my case. Just run scrcpy.exe in the win powershell after decompressing the zip file and connecting the android phone to the computer through USB(Do not forget to navigate to decompressed directory). If the exe fails, please enable USB debugging in the android phone. To do so, press build number in android setting several times to enable developer mode. Then, USB debugging mode in developer mode should be enabled. I hope it will be useful. Link: https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/doc/windows.md
